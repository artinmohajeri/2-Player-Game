# 2PlayerGame
this is my first game which i have make it with python.
the right player moves with the arrow keys on the bottom of the keybord and it shoots bullets by right ctrl.
the left player moves right with 3, left with 1, down with 2, up with f2 and shoots by tilde key(which is on the left side of 1).
numbers for the movment of the left player is on the topleft of the keyboard.
each one has 10 lives if anyone loses all of its lives the game will be restarted again and again
feel free to give me any advise to make my games better
